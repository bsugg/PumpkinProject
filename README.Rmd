# Discovery  

As a graduate level course offering at North Carolina State University, *ST542 - Statistical Practice* provides a discussion-based introduction to statistical practice that is geared towards students in the final semester of their Master of Statistics degree. Students  practice writing and presenting throughout the semester, gaining soft skills that aren't necessarily covered in other statistical courses. Students are paired and assigned to consulting engagements provided by the instructor that are selected from a list of projects submitted by researchers on campus. Covered topics of the course include negotiating expectations with clients, technical writing and editing, data cleaning and visualization, and finding research ideas from consulting projects.  

## Participants  

**Client:** Kim Heagy *(NCSU Horticulture Grad Student)*  
**Consultants:** Brian Sugg, Chengxi Zou *(NCSU Statistics Grad Students)*  

## Project Background  

Pumpkins are an emerging specialty crop in North Carolina. In 2019 the state produced 713,000 cwt of pumpkins on 3,000 acres, ranking 6th in the United States where overall national production is steadily increasing. With the rise in pumpkin production there is an increasing need for providing clear guidelines to North Carolina farmers on how plant density impacts overall production. In the absence of clear guidelines, North Carolina Extension Agents have noticed a variety of methods in how farmers grow pumpkins. There is a challenge in not only determining how to optimize land usage, but also in how to optimize the capacity of transportation bins for moving pumpkins to market. Another challenge facing farmers is the rise in commodity prices for fertilizer, the primary means for applying nitrogen to crops.  

Taking into consideration these challenges, it has become necessary to provide advice to farmers on how growing conditions affect the yield of pumpkin crops. As part of her thesis for her graduate program at NC State, Kim Heagy has focused her research in two areas on how to grow pumpkins most efficiently:  

1. Researching plant density by conducting a plant spacing study, where the hypothesis is pumpkins grown closer together will have a higher overall yield.  
2. Researching fertilizer application levels by conducting a separate nitrogen study, where the hypothesis is higher leaf nitrogen composition will indicate higher yields.  

The two studies were conducted at the NC State Extension Upper Mountain Research Station under the care of North Carolina Extension Agents.  

## Expectations  

This project will be expected to deliver...  

1. One  
2. Two  
3. Three

# Data Processing  

Raw data from the research conducted in 2020 and 2021 was provided in multiple Excel files. An inventory is outlined below of the source files that were received:  

* `2020 Pumpkin Results for Joy.xlsx`  
    + 2020 Spacing Study  
* `2020 stand count.xlsx`  
    + 2020 Spacing Study Stand Counts  
* `2021 Pumpkin Trial Data.xlsx`  
    + 2021 Spacing Study  
    + 2021 Nitrogen Study  
    + 2021 Leaf Composition Study  
* `2021 Bin Pumpkin Sizes.xlsx`  
    + 2021 Bin Capacity Study  

## Data Formatting  

Each of the provided files required formatting in Excel prior to importing into R. A full step-by-step overview of the changes made within each Excel workbook is outlined further below. Generally speaking, the formatting effort focused on getting the worksheets into a table form. This included tasks such as removing unnecessary blank rows and columns, ensuring categorical values were consistently spelled and spaced ("10 x 1" rather than "10x 1"), along with other minor changes to assist with a clean import to R.  

### 2020 Pumpkin Results for Joy.xlsx  

This file contained the 2020 spacing study data, consisting of three worksheets total, with one worksheet for each of the three metrics that were recorded during the harvest (weight, length, diameter). The worksheet inventory included:  

* `Spacing Weight`  
* `Spacing Length`  
* `Spacing Diameter`  

The below formatting steps were followed for each of the three worksheets:  

1. Removed empty rows and empty columns from the top and the left of the main data frame  
    + Resulted in all column names moving up to row 1  
2. Removed empty rows between records that were separating `reps`  
3. Inserted 1 column at column D position as `Spacing` to hold a concatenation of the `Row Distance` and `In Row Distance` columns, to match the same presentation of the `Spacing` variable in the 2021 data  
    + Formula = `CONCATENATE($E2," x ",$F2)` and apply down entire column  
4. Copied the new `Spacing` column D and pasted back as values only to remove formula dependence on `Row Distance` and `In Row Distance`  
5. Deleted the `Row Distance` and `In Row Distance` columns after concatenation  
6. Checked `Green Fruit` column E to ensure all values were evenly spaced by ", " ("comma space") for parsing during the import process  
7. Repeated the above steps 1 - 6 for the other two worksheets  

Finally, the file was renamed to `2020pumpkinData.xlsx` after formatting for easy future reference.

### 2020 stand count.xlsx  

This file contained the stand count data from the 2020 spacing study, which was not part of the original file `2020 Pumpkin Results for Joy.xlsx`. The worksheet inventory included:  

* `Sheet1`  

The below formatting steps were followed:  

1. Removed empty rows and empty columns from the top and the left of the main data frame  
    + Resulted in all column names moving up to row 1  

Finally, the file was renamed to `2020standCount.xlsx` after formatting for easy future reference.  

### 2021 Pumpkin Trial Data.xlsx  

This file contained the 2021 spacing study, nitrogen study, and leaf composition study data, consisting of nine worksheets total, with one worksheet for each of the three metrics that were recorded during the harvest (weight, length, diameter) for each of the three studies. The worksheet inventory included:  

* `Spacing Weights (lbs)`  
* `Spacing Lengths (inches)`  
* `Spacing Diameters (inches)`  
* `Nitrogen Weights (lbs)`  
* `Nitrogen Lengths (inches)`

2. Removed empty rows between records that were separating `reps`  
3. Checked `Spacing` column F to ensure all values were evenly spaced for consistent categorical values  
    + Example: Adjusted `5x 8` to `5 x 8`  
4. Checked `Green Fruit` column G to ensure all values were evenly spaced by ", " ("comma space") for parsing during the import process  
5. Repeated the above steps 1 - 4 for the other two spacing study worksheets  

#### Nitrogen Study  

The below formatting steps were followed for the `Nitrogen Weights (lbs)` worksheet:  

1. Removed empty column A, so the table starts in column A  
2. Removed empty rows between records that were separating `reps`  
3. Checked column B - `Nitrogen Rate` to ensure all values were spaced with 1 space between the number and unit of measure, and no spaces were within the unit of measure  
    + Example: Adjusted `lbs/ acre` to `lbs/acre` for consistency  
4. Renamed worksheet to `Nitrogen Weights (lbs) Orange`  
5. Created a copy of the worksheet, and renamed the  copy as `Nitrogen Weights (lbs) Green`  
6. In the `Nitrogen Weights (lbs) Orange` worksheet:  
    + Deleted columns V through AT to remove all green pumpkin data  
    + Deleted the top row so all column headers move up to row 1  
7. In the `Nitrogen Weights (lbs) Green` worksheet:  
    + Deleted columns G through V to remove all orange pumpkin data  
    + Deleted the top row so all column headers move up to row 1  

The below formatting steps were followed for the `Nitrogen Lengths (inches)` worksheet:  

1. Removed empty column A, so the table starts in column A  
2. Removed empty rows between records that were separating `reps`  
3. Checked column B - `Nitrogen Rate` to ensure all values were spaced with 1 space between the number and unit of measure, no spaces were within the unit of measure, and no extra forward slashes were present

#### Leaf Composition Study  

The below formatting steps were followed for each of the three worksheets for the leaf composition study:  

1. Removed empty rows and empty columns from the top and the left of the main data frame  
    + Resulted in all column names moving up to row 1  
2. Removed empty rows between records that were separating `reps`  
3. Removed empty column E  
4. Checked `Nitrogen Rate` column B to ensure all values were evenly spaced for consistent categorical values  
    + Example: Adjusted `lbs/ acre` to `lbs/acre` for consistency  
5. Repeated the above steps 1 - 4 for the other two leaf composition study worksheets  

**Note:** The `Nitrogen Rate` value for `Plot` 302 in the `Leaf Analysis Nitrogen (%)` worksheet was blank. Updated to reflect the value of `200 lbs/acre` that was associated with this plot in the `Leaf Analysis Phosphorus (%)` and `Leaf Analysis Potassium (%)` worksheets.  

**Note:** The `Treatment` value for `Plot` 406 in the `Leaf Analysis Nitrogen (%)` worksheet was listed as `4`. Updated to reflect the treatment value of `2` that was associated with this plot in the `Leaf Analysis Phosphorus (%)` and `Leaf Analysis Potassium (%)` worksheets.

write_xlsx(nitrogenWeight,"nitrogenWeight.xlsx")
write_xlsx(nitrogenLength,"nitrogenLength.xlsx")
write_xlsx(nitrogenDiameter,"nitrogenDiameter.xlsx")
write_xlsx(leafData,"leafData.xlsx")

# Change directory back to CleanData, then to R
setwd("..")
setwd("./R/")

# Export R data objects to RData file
save(spacingData,
     nitrogenData,
     nitrogenWeight,
     nitrogenLength,
     nitrogenDiameter,
     leafData,

# Analysis  

To be conducted...  

# Conclusions  

include = FALSE prevents code and results from appearing in the finished file. R Markdown still runs the code in the chunk  
echo = FALSE prevents code, but not the results from appearing in the finished file. This is a useful way to embed figures  
message = FALSE prevents messages that are generated by code from appearing in the finished file  
warning = FALSE prevents warnings that are generated by code from appearing in the finished  
fig.cap = "..." adds a caption to graphical results
